## Spatial data prep

This folder contains the raw spatial data acquired from outside sources in addition to scripts used to clean and prep the data. All shapefile outputs are saved in the `shp` folder and all raster outputs are saved in the `rasters` folder.

Scripts include:

- `shapefile_prep.Rmd` preparation of raw vector data

- `raster_prep.Rmd` creation of ocean rasters

- `map_for_report.Rmd` experimenting with different interactive map options

Raw data includes:

- `shorelines_2011` from David Smith at Redlands University
