# Summary 

The sea level rise pressure for Tetiaroa will be derived from a global raster of monthly data indicating sea level anomalies from 1993 to present. This data is clipped to three nautical miles of the coastline in the US Northeast region and aggregated to annual means. All data is rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum annual anomaly across the time series as the reference point.
