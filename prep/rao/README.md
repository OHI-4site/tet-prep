### Tetiaroa Ocean Health Index: Resource Access Opportunities

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the data layers for the artisanal opportunities goal.

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessment year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes. Each year folder contains the following sub-folders:

- `raw_data` folder contains any raw data 
- `int` folder contains any intermediate data frames or layers created
- `output` contains all final output layers
