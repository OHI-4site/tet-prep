### Tetiaroa Ocean Health Index: Coastal Protection

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the data layers for the Coastal Protection goal.

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessment year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes. Each year folder contains the following sub-folders:

- `_raw_data` folder contains all raw quantiative and qualitative data used, as well as the sources from which the data was generated, if needed
- `int` folder contains any intermediate files created in the data prep process
- `output` folder contains the final layers created - these layers are the ones saved to the Toolbox
