### Tetiaroa Ocean Health Index: Species Diversity 

Species diversity creates resilience, however since we already created a layer in the SPP goal that reflects this, we will use that as our resilience layer. The layer itself is created in the toolbox (tet_scores repository) in the Funcions.R scripe.
