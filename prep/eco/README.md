This folder describes the methods used to prepare the data layers for the Livelihoods and Economies goal.

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessment year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted). The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes. Each year folder contains the following sub-folders:

- `raw_data` folder contains all raw data 
- `int` folder contains any intermediate data frames or layers created
- `output` contains all final output layers
