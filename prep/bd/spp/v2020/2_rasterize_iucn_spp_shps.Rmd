#Summary 

Using a set of IUCN species range maps, rasterize each species range map to 1km x 1km raster using `fasterize`.  Use `presence` field from shapefile.

* Subpopulation polygons must be identified and rasterized separately from the parent polygon; this must be done by sciname and subpop fields since the polygon IDs are based upon the parent ID.
* Regional assessments need not be determined at this stage - the ID numbers match the global ID numbers (including subpops).

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
